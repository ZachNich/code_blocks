# CodeXplode

> Created by Tom, Tanner, and Zach.

Welcome to CodeXplode--a fun matching game guides young kids and beginners through language-agnostic coding syntax! 

This is a single-page React app mostly styled with React-Bootstrap. 

## Difficulties

CodeXplode was a surprisingly difficult app to manage and create. What we expected to be a quick drag-and-drop game with fun, shiny graphics, ended up being quite the monster to put together. Dragging and dropping in React is much harder than it seems, especially when you want to dynamically match style on different components along the way. 

We also enjoyed learning more of React-Bootstrap during this project. The three of us hadn't had much experience with the styling library before, so though it slowed our progress down, we're thankful for the learning opportunity. 

## The Future

In the future, we'd love to fix some glitches, add an animated sprite avatar that accompanies the learner throughout their lessons, and add some fun graphics that explode the blocks of code when a bomb is correctly placed. 

Thanks for checking our project out!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
